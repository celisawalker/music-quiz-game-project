# How Well Do You Know Music?
This is a quiz game app that allows the player to run test their music knowledge in 15 questions. Players can choose which era of music they would like to be tested on. If the wrong answer is selected three times, the game ends and the user can try again.

## Future Plans 
In the future, I would like to add functionality to the answer buttons that changes the color to red or green based on whether or not the player's selection is the correct one. I would also like to add an animation at the end of a winning game to celebrate the player's success. Finally, the game currently does not reset after a second round of play so the user must refresh the page in order to play again. I would like to change this so that the player can try to play as many times as they like without physically refreshing the page themselves.
